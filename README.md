- I’m interested in Next generation sequencing specially in whole genome sequencing (WGS), metagenomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and single cell omic data analysis.
- I have 3+ years of experience on working with command line and R.
- Recently, I have started to use Github to organise my analysis projects.
